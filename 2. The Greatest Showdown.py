# Task 1: Identify the Greatest  Write a Python program that asks the user to enter
#  three numbers. Your code should then identify and print out the largest number among the three.

#number1 = float(input("enter the first numbers: "))
#number2 = float(input("enter the second numbers: "))
#number3 = float(input("enter the third numbers: "))

#if number1 >= number2 and number1 >= number3 :
   #largest = number1
#elif number2 >= number1 and number2 >= number3 :
   # largest = number2
#else:
 #   largest = number3       
   
#print ("the largest number is :", largest )

# Task 2: Identify the Smallest
